# Assignment 2 - AR Foundation basics (ungraded)

**Date**: 11/02/2022

**Group members participating**: Rasmus Thorsøe, Sam Martin Vargas Giagnocavo, Nishka Dasgupta

**Activity duration**: [TODO: Insert hours spend]

## Goal
- Begin building a phone app.
- Learn basic Unity functionality such as scene creation, plane detection, object tracking.
- Create a mobile app that can add an object tethered to a plane in the physical world.

## Plan
As in the previous week, we initially decided that each member should work on all exercises independently, to facilitate learning. 

## Results
Exercise 1 was completed by all of us in the TA session. Over the course of the week we each worked independently on the remaining exercises and
made different degrees of progress. On Friday we decided to split the remaining coding work between Sam and Rasmus, with Nishka working on the 
report.

### <ins>Exercise 1.2</ins>
[Explain what you see in the application. What are being tracked in the physical world?]

### <ins>Exercise 2.1</ins>
[Explain: what is the size of your object in the physical world? How does unity's units relate to real world units?


Explain: what happens if you insert a cube on top of a cube?]

### <ins>Exercise 2.2</ins>
[Explain why your objects fall through the ground.

Try to place an object on top of another object. Explain what happens and why?


Explain the difference between the two different raycast functions (Unity's build-in and AR Foundation's)?
- When will you use each function?
- Can you combine them in a meaningful way?
- If you want to use gravity in your project, how can you change the design of the debug planes to look nicer?]

### <ins>Exercise 2.4</ins>
[Optional: why we chose a particular indication marker]

### <ins>Exercise 2.5</ins>
[Explain and demonstrate the objects you have created.]

### <ins>Exercise 3.1</ins>
[Explain what happens when you move the physical image.]

### <ins>Exercise 3.2</ins>
[Explain: how does the two MO's look compared to each other? Why do they look this way?]

## Conclusion
During this assignment we learned the basics of mixing the virtual world with the physical world in Unity. These concepts will be vital to our final project.

We also further refined our final project idea.
