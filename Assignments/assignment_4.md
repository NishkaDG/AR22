# Assignment 4 - Interaction techniques (graded)

**Date**: 20/02/2022

**Group members participating**: Rasmus Thors√∏e, Sam Martin Vargas Giagnocavo and Nishka Dasgupta.

**Activity duration**: 7-8 hours

## Goal
- Further develop our AR app.
- Enable an expanded selection of objects for users to choose from.
- Enable customisation and animation of objects.

## Plan
The plan was for Sam to work on Exercise 1 (designing the catalogue for our posters), and for Nishka and Rasmus to do Exercises 2.1 (animation) and 2.2 (customisation)
respectively. For the catalogue we planned to keep it in its previous position (a horizontal bar near the bottom of the screen), accessible via a 
button with a shopping bag logo on it. For animation, we decided to have blinking text displaying the name of the selected poster. For customisation
we decided to let the user select if they wanted the texture of the poster to be matte or glossy.

## Results


### Exercise 1
[TODO: description]

### Exercise 2.1
For the animation we decided to go with blinking text displaying the name of the artwork that the user has placed from the catalogue. We achieved
this by inserting the text into a button and setting a timer to periodically enable and disable it for as long as the toggle for animation was on.

### Exercise 2.2
For customisation we decided to let the user choose real-world texture of the object, i.e, should the artwork be matte or glossy.
